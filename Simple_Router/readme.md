Build a router circuit which forwards data from the input (din) to one of four outputs (dout0, dout1, dout2, or dout3), specified by the address input (addr).

The address is a two bit value whose decimal representation determines which output value to use. Append to dout the decimal representation of addr to get the output signal name dout{address decimal value}. For example, if addr=b11 then the decimal representation of addr is 3, so the output signal name is dout3.

The input has an enable signal (din_en), which allows the input to be forwarded to an output when enabled. If an output is not currently being driven to, then it should be set to 0.
Input and Output Signals

    din - Input data.
    din_en - Enable signal for din. Forwards data from input to an output if 1, does not forward data otherwise.
    addr - Two bit destination address. For example addr = b11 = 3 indicates din should be forwarded to output value 3 (dout3).
    dout0 - Output 0. Corresponds to addr = b00.
    dout1 - Output 1. Corresponds to addr = b01.
    dout2 - Output 2. Corresponds to addr = b10.
    dout3 - Output 3. Corresponds to addr = b11.

Example

Data is routed from din to dout1, because addr = b01 = 1. When addr1 changes to b11, the data is routed to dout3 instead of dout1. Once din_en is disabled, no data is routed to any output.
